## Improving Educational Choice through Behavioural Interventions: an Experimental Approach | Aleksandr Popov

Abstract

Today's environment is inundated with information and data, greatly influencing our daily lives and decision-making processes. However, this abundance of information can overwhelm individuals, leading to confusion, suboptimal decisions, and frustration. This is particularly critical in decision-making areas with implicit but significant rewards, such as choosing an educational trajectory. Therefore, designers of educational information systems should analyse the behaviour of course entrants to support future educational choices. To address this issue, we employ the design science research methodology, which focuses on creating and evaluating innovative solutions for practical problems. By applying this approach, we aim to develop interventions that enhance decision-making processes, improve decision quality, and ultimately yield positive educational outcomes. One potential solution is to combine behavioural science and decision science theories to create decision support systems. These systems describe decision-making as a sequential multistep model involving the formation of awareness, consideration, and evaluation sets. Behavioural interventions, particularly self-deployed ones, are effective in guiding decision-making behaviour without compromising autonomy. 

To test the effectiveness of such interventions in enhancing the course selection decision-making experience in learning systems, this paper proposes an evidence-based approach for creating an education decision-making environment within digital platforms. The study designs a controlled crowdsource experiment using a two-version prototype to investigate the impact of interactive design interventions on user perceptions of the quality of the educational alternative selection process. To measure decision quality, the research introduces subjective and objective metrics such as awareness, engagement, and transparency. Additionally, reinforcement learning algorithms (multi-armed bandits) are applied to validate the adaptivity potential of these interventions. 

The goals of this study can be summarized as follows: (1) prototype and evaluate an experimental setup to assess education decision-making interventions; (2) design and evaluate self-deployed behavioural interventions to reduce cognitive load during the decision-making process; and (3) identify limitations of crowdsource experiments for studying education decision-making.
